Intel® Neural Networks GPU HAL
===

Introduction
---

The Intel® Neural Network GPU Hardware Abstraction Layer (NN HAL) provides the GPU hardware acceleration for Android Neural Networks (NN) API. Intel Neural Networks GPU HAL takes the advantage of the Intel GEN Graphics engine, enables high performance and low power implementation of Neural Networks API.<br>
For the first version, Intel® Neural Network GPU HAL utilizes Intel® OpenGL Driver Compute Shader for TensorFlow Operations acceleration. Plan to switch to utilize Intel® Vulkan Driver in the next stage.

Supported Operations
